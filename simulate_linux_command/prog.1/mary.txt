Mary had a 
little lamb
little lamb
little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
its fleece was white as snow

Everywhere that
Mary went
Mary went
Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
the lamb was sure to go

It followed her to
school one day
school one day
school one day
It followed her to school one day
which was against the rules
